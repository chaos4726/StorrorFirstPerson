-- STORROR has no first-person view of its athlete, so it is made here: a camera of the mod's own sits at his eyes
-- (just in front of his head bone) and looks where the player looks, the controller's view, so the right stick
-- still turns it and moving is still along the way he looks. His head, a mesh part of its own, is hidden so that
-- it does not fill the view; the rest of him stays, for looking down at. Off during the new-file opening, which
-- has its cameras, and outside a game. When it goes off, the view goes back to STORROR's own camera behind him.
--
-- The view turns with his body (asked 2026-10-14: "the head or camera isnt attached to the body example being when
-- doing a flip the camera stays horizontal"): his upper chest's turn away from how it sits while he stands is put
-- on top of where the player looks, so a flip goes head over heels, a roll rolls, a vault tips the view. Only
-- big turns count in full: the sway of walking, running and standing (under 20 degrees) is left out, and between
-- 20 and 45 degrees it comes in gradually. How the chest sits while he stands is measured whenever he stands
-- still, so it follows STORROR's own idle.
